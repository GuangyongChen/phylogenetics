   contain the root `toctree` directive.

Phylogenetics package
=====================

A Python API for constructing phylogenet

The `phylogenetics` package was designed for two purposes:

1. Create a single, persistent python object for managing phylogenetic data
2. Simple, one-stop python API for running through a complete phylogenetic pipeline.

An annoying problem in phylogenetics (and bioinformatics in general) is constantly converting
a set of sequence data to the many different file formats (i.e. fasta, phylip,
xml, etc.). Phylogenetics tries to make this conversion simple and seamless. In most cases, it does this automatically
and you shouldn't even know its writing this formats underneath the hood.

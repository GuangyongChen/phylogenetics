Welcome to phylogenetics documentation!
=========================================

The `phylogenetics` package was designed for two purposes: 

1. Create a single, persistent python object for managing phylogenetic data
2. Simple, one-stop python API for running through acomplete phylogenetic pipeline.


1. Persistent Phylogenetics Python Object
===========================================

Let me introduce you to the `HomologSet` object. 



2. Python API for phylogenetics pipeline
===========================================

This can analyze HomologSet objects in many ways. A few include BLASTing databases for homolog sequence data, constructing multiple sequence alignments between sequences, generating phylogenetic trees of sequence data, and reconstructing the ancestral sequences at nodes on trees. Basically,

   :maxdepth: 2
